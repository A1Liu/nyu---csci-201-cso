# Computer Systems Organization
My assignments, projects, programs, etc. from CSCI-UA 201 007 CSO at NYU. Also included are some files that I made while getting the hang of the C programming language.  

## Contents
* [Learning C](#learn)
* [Homework](#homework)
* [Projects](#projects)
* [Utilities](#utils)
* [Useful sources and links](#sources)

# Learning C <a name="learn"></a>
The [*learn folder*](learn/) contains all the files that I used to learn the C programming language. More information on its organization can be found in its [*README file*](learn/README.md).  

# Homework <a name="homework"></a>

The [*hw folder*](hw/) contains all the documents for homework assigned in CSCI-201. Exercises are named "hwXX" where "XX" is a number.  

# Projects <a name="projects"></a>

The [*projects folder*](projects/) contains all the project folders for the projects assigned in CSCI-201. Each is summarized individually in the folder's [*README file*](projects/README.md), and each project folder contains its own README file describing the project.  

# Utilities <a name="utils"></a>

The [*utils folder*](utils/) contains projects and files that I reuse often, i.e. a function to read from the command line. More details for each item it contains can be found in its [*README file*](utils/README.md).
