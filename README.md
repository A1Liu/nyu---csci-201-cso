# Computer Systems Organization
My assignments, projects, programs, etc. from CSCI-UA 201 007 CSO at NYU. Also included are some files that I made while getting the hang of the C programming language.  

<!-- ## Contents
* [Learning C](#learn)
* [Homework](#homework)
* [Labs](#labs)
* [Utilities](#utils)
* [Useful Sources and Links](#sources) -->

## Learning C <a name="learn"></a>
The [*learn* folder](learn/) contains all the files that I used to learn the C programming language. More information on its organization can be found in its [*README* file](learn/README.md).  

## Homework <a name="homework"></a>

The [*hw* folder](hw/) contains all the documents for homework assigned in CSCI-201. Exercises are named "hwXX" where "XX" is a number.  

## Labs <a name="labs"></a>

The [*labs* folder](labs/) contains all the project folders for the labs assigned in CSCI-201. Each is summarized individually in the folder's [*README* file](labs/README.md), and each project folder contains its own README file describing the project.  

## Utilities <a name="utils"></a>

The [*utils* folder](utils/) contains projects and files that I reuse often, i.e. a function to read from the command line. More details for each item it contains can be found in its [*README* file](utils/README.md).
