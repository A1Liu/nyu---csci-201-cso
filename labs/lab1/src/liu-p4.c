/*

##### Part 4
Write a main program that does all the following.  I suggest,
but do not require, that you use `getint()` from the notes and
given on page 97 of the book.

1. Reads a positive integer *N*.
2. Checks that 0<*N*<100.  If *N* is not in that range, prints
an error message and terminates.
3. Assuming *N* is legal
	1. Reads *N* more integers into an array.
	2. Prints the contents of the array, one number per line.
	3. Calls your sort routine from **Part A**.
	4.  Prints the sorted array, one number per line.

void sortInt(int n, int A[n]);

int main(int argc, char *argv[argc]) {//Part B
	return 0;
}


void sortInt(int n, int A[n]) {//Part A
	// This routine sorts the array A.
	// Since arrays are passed to functions as a pointers, you do not
	// need the pointer trick we did in class for bad_swap in 5.2.
}
