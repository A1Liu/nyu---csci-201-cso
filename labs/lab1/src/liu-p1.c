/*

## Part 1
Write a main program that has three command line arguments called
`start`, `end`, and `incr`. All three are type `int`.
Your program prints a series of numbers
`start`, `start+incr`, `start+(2*incr)`, `...`, `end`.
For example, if the three arguments are `2 10 3`, the values
printed are `2 5 8 10`.
Note from the example that the `end` value is printed even if it is
not of the form `start` plus a multiple of `incr`.

You may assume for problem 1 that the arguments are legal, i.e.,
`start<end` and `incr>0`.
