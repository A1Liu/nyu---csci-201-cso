# Lab 1 Simple C Programs
This lab consists of simple programs in C, meant to test fundamental concepts like parsing command line arguments, doing basic operations, control flow, and standard input/output.

## Description of files
All Files are named according to the convention `liu-p#.c`, where `#` represents the number of the part (i.e. `2A` or `3`). Each part of the lab is contained in its own file, with subsections also defined in their own file (2A is in a different file from 2B).
