# Lab 1: Simple C Programs
This lab consists of simple programs in C, meant to test fundamental concepts like parsing command line arguments, doing basic operations, control flow, and standard input/output.

## Compiling files
All files should be compiled individually with `gcc filename.c`, where `filename` is the name of the file.

## Description of files
All Files are named according to the convention `liu-p#.c`, where `#` represents the number of the part (i.e. `2` or `3`).
