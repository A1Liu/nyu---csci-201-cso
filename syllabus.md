# CSCI-201 Syllabus
The following is the syllabus for CSCI-201, Adapted from the "Administrivia" section of the [lecture notes](https://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/cso/class-notes.html).

## 1 Contact Information

* email: my-last-name AT nyu DOT edu (best method)
* web: https://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb
* office: 60 Fifth Ave, Room 316
* office phone: 212 998 3344

## 2 Course Web Page
There is a web site for the course. You can find it from my home page, which is listed above, or from the department's home page.

* You can find these lecture notes on the course home page. Please let me know if you can't find them.
The notes are updated as bugs are found or improvements made. As a result, I do not recommend printing the notes now (if at all).
* I will place markers at the end of each lecture after the lecture is given. For example, the "Start Lecture #1" marker above can be thought of as "End Lecture #0".

## 3 Textbook
The course has two texts:  

* Bryant and O.Hallaron, *Computer Systems: A programmer's Perspective*
* Kernighan and Richie, *The C Programming Language*

I own, like, and will use Kernighan and Richie (Richie is the creator of C). However, if you already own another C book, that is probably good enough.  

## 4 Email, and the Class Mailing List
* You should have all been automatically added to the mailing list for this course and should have received a test message from me.
* Mail to the list should be sent to OS-201-FA18-fadd@nyu.edu
* Membership on the list is Required; I assume that messages I send to the mailing list are read.
* If you want to send mail just to me, use my-last-name AT nyu DOT edu not the mailing list.
* Questions on the labs should go to the mailing list. You are encouraged to answer questions posed on the list as well. Note that replies are sent to the list.
* I will respond to all questions. If another student has answered the question before I get to it, I will confirm if the answer given is correct.
* Please use proper mailing list etiquette.
    * Send plain text messages rather than (or at least in addition to) html.
    * Use Reply to contribute to the current thread, but NOT to start another topic.
    * If quoting a previous message, trim off irrelevant parts.
    * Use a descriptive Subject: field when starting a new topic.
    * Do not use one message to ask two unrelated questions.
* As you will see, when I respond to a message, I either place my reply after the original text or interspersed with it (rather than putting the reply at the top). This preference is most relevant for detailed questions that lead to serious conversations involving many messages. I find it quite useful when reviewing a serious conversations to have the entire conversation in chronological order.
I believe you would also find it useful when reviewing for an exam.

## 5 Grades
Grades are based on the labs and exams; the weighting will be approximately as follows (but see homework below):

|Percent|Part|
|---|---|
|30%|Labs|
|30%|Midterm|
|40%|Final Exam|

## 6 The Upper Left Board
I use the upper left board for lab/homework assignments and announcements. I should never erase that board. Viewed as a file it is group readable (the group is those in the room), appendable by just me, and (re-)writable by no one. If you see me start to erase an announcement, please let me know.  

I try very hard to remember to write all announcements on the upper left board and I am normally successful. If, during class, you see that I have forgotten to record something, please let me know. **HOWEVER**, even if I forgot and no one reminds me, the assignment has still been given.  

## 7 Homework and Labs
I make a distinction between homeworks and labs.

Labs are
* *Required.*
* Due several lectures later (date given on assignment).
* Announced in the notes and during class class. Details in NYU Classes with supplemental material on separate web pages. Your solution is submitted via NYU Classes.
* Graded and form part of your final grade.
* Penalized for lateness.
* The penalty is 1 point per day up to 10 days; then 5 points per day.
* This penalty is too mildâ€”a one week late lab can be an A; two weeks late might be a C.

Homeworks are
* Optional.
* Due the beginning of two lectures later.
* Not accepted late.
* The assignment is given in the notes and NYU Classes; your solution is submitted via Classes.
* Checked for completeness and graded 0/1/2.
* Able to help, but not hurt, your final grade.

### 7.1 Homework Numbering
Homeworks are numbered by the class in which they are assigned. So any homework given today is homework #1. Even if I do not give homework today, any homework assigned next class would be homework #2. So the homework present in the notes for lecture #n is homework #n (even if I inadvertently forgot to write it to the upper left board).  

### 7.2 Doing Labs on non-NYU Systems
You may *develop* (i.e., write and test) lab assignments on any system you wish, e.g., your laptop. However...

* You are responsible for any non-nyu machine. I extend deadlines if the nyu machines are down, not if yours are. So you should back up on an nyu server any work done on your personal computers.
* You should test your assignments on the nyu systems, for this class that means <span style="background-color:pink">courses2.cims.nyu.edu</span>. More on how to do this later.
If some confusion arises, I can (and do) believe dates on courses2 and friends. I can **not** believe dates on your laptop since you can change them backwards in time.
* In an ideal world, a program written in a high level language such as Python, Java, C, or C++ that works on one system would also work on any other system. Sadly, this ideal is not always achieved, despite marketing claims to the contrary. So, although you may *develop* your lab on any system, you must ensure that it *runs* on courses2, which the TAs will use when grading your labs.
You submit your labs using "NYU Classes".  

### 7.3 Obtaining Help with the Labs
Good methods for obtaining help include  

1. Asking me during office hours (see my home page for my hours).
2. Asking the mailing list.
3. Asking another student.
4. But ...  
  **Your lab must be your own.**  
  That is, each student must submit a unique lab. Naturally, simply changing comments, variable names, etc. does **not** produce a unique lab.  
### 7.4 Computer Language Used for Labs
This course uses the C computer language.  
## 8 A Grade of Incomplete
The rules for incompletes and grade changes are set by the school> and not the department or individual faculty member. The rules set by CAS can be found in <http://cas.nyu.edu/object/bulletin0608.ug.academicpolicies.html>, which states:  

The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that the student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that there is the possibility that the student will eventually pass the course when all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor.  

The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not used when there is no possibility that the student will eventually pass the course. If the course work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the student's grade point average.  

All work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the following spring term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up by the end of the following fall term. Students who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center for an Extension of Incomplete Form, which must be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely granted.  

Once a final (i.e., non-incomplete) grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the transcript, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course work.  

## 9 Academic Integrity Policy
This email from the assistant director, describes the policy.

<pre>
  Dear faculty,

  The vast majority of our students comply with the
  department's academic integrity policies; see

  www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/academic_integrity.html
  www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Graduate/academic_integrity.html

  Unfortunately, every semester we discover incidents in
  which students copy programming assignments from those of
  other students, making minor modifications so that the
  submitted programs are extremely similar but not identical.

  To help in identifying inappropriate similarities, we
  suggest that you and your TAs consider using Moss, a
  system that automatically determines similarities between
  programs in several languages, including C, C++, and Java.
  For more information about Moss, see:

  http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/

  Feel free to tell your students in advance that you will be
  using this software or any other system.  And please emphasize,
  preferably in class, the importance of academic integrity.

  Rosemary Amico
  Assistant Director, Computer Science
  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences

**Remark:** The chapter/section numbers for the material on C, agree with Kernighan and Plauger. However, the material is quite standard so, as mentioned before, if you already own a C book that you like, it should be fine.
